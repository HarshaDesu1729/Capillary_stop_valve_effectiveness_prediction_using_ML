# Capillary_stop_valve_effectiveness_prediction_using_ML
A stop valve is designed to stop the flow in capillary microchannels. The effectiveness of the valve is tested by varying different parameters. An ML model is developed to predict the flow conditions of the valve

The parameters considers while using the model are Contact Angle Surface tension of the liquid, Width and height of the channels before and after the valve. 

The data for training the model is attained from experimental data

The Data nearly contains 350 rows
